# Predicting Impressions from Advertisement Expenditures and Advertisement Duration of Political Ads on Snapchat
This repository includes simple and multiple linear regression analyses for Snapchat political ad data. It also includes a data visualization and findings from exploratory analysis with Python. 
## Background ## 
  Throughout the past several years, political campaigns have spent astronomical sums of money on advertising and social media outreach. Most notably, Johns Hopkins University Alum and Former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, [spent $1 billion on his campaign, of which 70% reportedly went towards advertising.](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-social-media-is-shaping-political-campaigns/) Former President Donald Trump spent around [$107 million on Facebook ads](https://abc7.com/presidential-race-campaign-spending-trump-political-ads-biden/7452228/) alone during the 2020 Presidential race, while President Joe Biden spent around [$94 million on Facebook ads](https://abc7.com/presidential-race-campaign-spending-trump-political-ads-biden/7452228/) in the same time frame. Although Facebook and Google have consistently dominated political advertising, rising social media platforms, like Snapchat, [offer access to the ‘Gen Z’ population and a larger audience of young voters.](https://deltalab.research.wesleyan.edu/2020/10/28/presidential-advertising-on-snapchat/) President Biden has already spent around [$3 million on Snapchat advertising](https://deltalab.research.wesleyan.edu/2020/10/28/presidential-advertising-on-snapchat/), in addition to fellow Democratic figures like Former NYC Mayor Bloomberg and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Given these figures, and the rising popularity of social media, we seek to determine whether we can predict the number of impressions (views) using advertising expenditures and advertisement duration in the year 2021 from Snapchat’s public Political Ads data. We expand on this analysis by utilizing Python to create new visualizations and further explore the data. 
## Business Question ##
  Can we predict the number of impressions (views) for an advertisement on Snapchat based on advertisement expenditures and advertisment duration of political advertisements on Snapchat during the year 2021? 
## Data Source ##
  [Snapchat Political Ads Data](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads)
  Snapchat publishes their political advertising data for each year and includes comprehensive information for each political advertisement on their platform. The data file includes basic information for each advertisement transaction such as a unique ID, the currency of the transaction, the cost of the advertisement, the start and end dates for the advertisement, the organization being advertised, and the paying advertiser. The file also includes demographic information such as age brackets, gender, geographic location, target radius, and advertising language. All transactions do not include comprehensive demographic information however every transaction does include the basic information. For the purposes of this analysis, advertisements with no specified end-date (on-going advertisements) were given end-dates of March 2, 2021 because the data was downloaded on March 2, 2021 and the analysis was performed on data that was present at this time. The data was kept in the analysis because the on-going advertisement data reflected the amount spent and the impressions generated thus far, and increased the sample size of the analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations ## 
### Simple Linear Regression ###
  Simple linear regression was performed to examine the relationship between advertisement expenditures and impressions (graph 1), and advertisement duration (graph 2) and impressions. Linear regression shows the potential relationship between an independent and dependent variable, and in this analysis it showed how the dependent variable, impressions, changed with each dependent variable. ![alt text](https://github.com/apate139/Snapchat-Political-Ads-Linear-Regression/blob/main/MP2%20IvsAE.png) The graph above shows how impressions increase as expenditures increase and indicates an R^2 value of 0.9566, which shows how well the model explains the outcome variable of impressions, in this case very well.  ![alt text](https://github.com/apate139/Snapchat-Political-Ads-Linear-Regression/blob/main/MP2%20IvsAD.png) The graph above shows how impressions change as advertisement duration changes and indicates an R^2 value of 0.0085, which shows how well the model explains the outcome variable of impressions, in this case not very well.  ![alt text](https://github.com/apate139/Predicting-impressions-from-ad-expenditures-and-ad-duration-for-political-ads-on-snapchat/blob/main/2020%20Snapchat%20Political%20Ad%20Impressions%20vs%20Duration%20of%20Ad.png) The graph above was produced using Python and shows the mean impressions (in millions) at different durations of ads (in days) from 2020-2021. There is a clear spike between 55-65 days and these are the largest average impressions values seen throughout the graph. 
### Multiple Linear Regression ### 
  Multiple linear regression was performed to examine the potential relationship between advertisement expenditures, advertisement duration, and impressions, however multiple linear regression cannot be shown graphically so no visualization was developed. Multiple linear regression shows the potential relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. 
## Findings ##
 The simple linear regression for advertisement expenditures (AE) and impressions had an R^2 value of 0.9566, which means that the regression model was a good predictor of the outcome variable, impressions. Although the p-value was < 0.05, which is statistically significant, we don’t have enough evidence to show that this relationship exists within this population. The simple linear regression for advertisement duration (AD) and impressions had an R^2 value of 0.0085, which means that the model was not a good predictor for the outcome variable, impressions. The p-value was > 0.05, which is not statistically significant, however we don’t have enough evidence to show that this relationship exists within this population. For the multiple linear regression, the R^2 value was 0.9566, however given that we are working with two independent variables, this value is more complex to interpret. The p-value for AD was 0.7435, which is not statistically significant, however we don’t have enough evidence to show that this relationship exists within this population. The p-value for AE was found to be 0, due to the value being rounded to 0, which is < 0.05 and statistically significant, however we don’t have enough evidence to show that this relationship exists within this population. The total observations for this regression model were 790, which is a large and shows our model is robust. The final interpretation of this model is: when we control for duration of advertisement, a one-unit difference in advertisement expenditure is associated with a 303.88684 increase in impressions. The equation yielded from this model is: y= -51992.873 -179.24531(duration of advertisement) +303.88684(advertising expenditure) 
  These findings indicate that there is a relationship between AE and impressions which is important to Snapchat because it shows their service is successful. Their promise to consumers is fair in that advertising costs lead to impressions and given the high R^2 value found for the association between AE and impressions, the model is a good predictor for the data. This information should be used to guide pricing options, for both Snapchat and consumers, based on predicted impressions from costs. It would be aided by additional data describing successful bids. [Bids are end goals specified by advertisers,](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/advertising-on-snapchat-how-pricing-works) and given what we know about expenditures and impressions (views), consumers may be persuaded by data analysis showing the association between expenditures and successful bids rather than just views. Clarifying this relationship can help Snapchat increase advertising revenue and aid political campaigns with using resources more efficiently as bids would offer more value for their money instead of just views.  
  
## Additional Findings from Python Analysis
The findings of the Python analysis indicate that there is a sharp spike in mean impressions between 55-65 days of duration of the advertisement and suggest there may be an optimal duration of advertisement. Snapchat can utilize this information to potentially charge more for durations shown to have greater mean impressions. Alternatively, clients can create campaigns, using this information, to maximize political advertising expenditures and interaction. Python provided a different perspective on this association by showing the mean impressions at different durations, which indicates durations that have significantly higher mean impressions. These durations can be emphasized by Snapchat to increase profits while consumers can evaluate the potential engagement of their proposed campaigns. These findings were not found in the Excel analysis, and add depth to the potential applications by both Snapchat and potential consumers. Additional data examining [successful bids](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/advertising-on-snapchat-how-pricing-works) would be useful to show how bids fluctuate with duration of advertisements. Clarifying this potential relationship could add support for increased prices from Snapchat and lend credibility to the promised results of their service, potentially enticing additional clients.
