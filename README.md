# Predicting Impressions from Advertising Expenditures and Advertising Duration of Political Ads on Snapchat # 
## Background ## 
Throughout the past several years, political campaigns have spent astronomical sums of money on advertising and social media outreach. Most notably, Johns Hopkins University Alum and Former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, [spent $1 billion on his campaign, of which 70% reportedly went towards advertising.](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-social-media-is-shaping-political-campaigns/) Former President Donald Trump spent around $107 million on Facebook ads alone during the 2020 Presidential race, while President Joe Biden spent around $94 million on Facebook ads in the same time frame. Although Facebook and Google have consistently dominated political advertising, rising social media platforms, like Snapchat, offer access to the ‘Gen Z’ population and a larger audience of young voters. President Biden has already spent around $3 million on Snapchat advertising, in addition to fellow Democratic figures like Former NYC Mayor Bloomberg and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Given these figures, and the rising popularity of social media, we seek to determine whether we can predict the number of impressions (views) using advertising expenditures and advertisement duration in the year 2021 from Snapchat’s public Political Ads data.
